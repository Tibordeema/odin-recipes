    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guanciale</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Parmigiano reggiano</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Egg yolks and whole eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Pepper </strong></li>
            <li><strong>No salt in sauce </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Garlic, optional </strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Batons</strong> – Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into 
                meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
            <li><Strong>Finely grate </Strong>the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino.</li>  
            <li><strong>Sauce – </strong>Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>   
            <li><strong>Cook pasta – </strong>Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>Reserve pasta cooking water – </strong>Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook guanciale</strong> until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don’t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
            <li><strong>Toss pasta in guanciale – </strong>Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat. </li>
            <li><strong>Transfer into sauce bowl –  </strong>Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
            <li><strong>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water </strong> into the bowl.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix vigorously </strong> with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve immediately in warm bowls.</strong> Pasta waits for no one!</li>
        </ol>
